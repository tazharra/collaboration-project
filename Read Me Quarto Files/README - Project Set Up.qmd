The collaboration project contains all R files, documents, analysis and calculations undertaken throughout the project.

The files have the following structure:

### Raw-Data

Contains the data compiled into one excel document. The collaborator provided the original file as a google sheet which we were not allowed to download. The data was in multiple tabs so it was combined into one data list.

### R

The R File contains the files used to undertaken the projects given to us by Karl. There are:

-   Gene Expression - Karl 1 Analysis.Rmd

-   Karl Task 2. Rmd

-   Karl Task 3.Rmd
